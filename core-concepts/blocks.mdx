## What is a Block?

Blocks, short for building blocks, are logical units used to build flows. You can think of them as No-code lego pieces that you can connect to create a flow.

Each block runs some code in background to carry out a function in your flow.

You can add a block to your canvas by dragging and dropping them from the block list.

We have 7 types of blocks:

1. `Core`
2. `Data Loaders`
3. `AI`
4. `Data Modifiers`
5. `Flow Control`
6. `Data Writers`
7. `Database I/O`
8. `External Flows (Automation as Nodes)`

All blocks take some inputs and produce some outputs. To configure a block you can simply click on it. It will open a side bar with configurable inputs.

You may also see inputs and output as handles on the left and right side of the block respectively.

You can connect blocks using these handles. Output data of a block can be connected to a input data of another block!

Connect as many blocks as you like. This creates a `flow` .

  We make custom blocks for enterprise users → [Request

## Updating Blocks

We make regular changes to all blocks to add functionality, improve performance and fix bugs. After we update a block, we preserve the older version of the blocks for flows that are already in use. We do this to avoid breaking your deployed flows. You will also see a notification on outdated blocks in flows to update them to newest version.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/core-concepts/update-block-light.png"
    alt="Update Block"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/core-concepts/update-block-dark.png"
    alt="Update Block"
  />
</Frame>

We highly recommend you keep the blocks in your workflows up-to date with the newest version for improved performance and better functionality.

We will send out emails when we make updates to blocks so you don’t miss any updates :)
