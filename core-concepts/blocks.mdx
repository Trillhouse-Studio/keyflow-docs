## ðŸ§±Â What is a Block?

Blocks, short for building blocks, are modular components used to build workflows. Each one is a step in a series of steps towards a goal. Think of them like individual no-code Lego pieces.

You can drag-and-drop them on to the canvas from the block list. We have 8 types of blocks.

1. `Core`
2. `Data Loaders`
3. `AI`
4. `Data Modifiers`
5. `Flow Control`
6. `Data Writers`
7. `Database I/O`
8. `External Flows (Automation as Nodes)`

Blocks generally take in inputs from other blocks, have some outputs, and can also have internal inputs. Many of these attributes may also be optional. Let's take a look at an example:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/terminology/what-is-block-light.png"
    alt="Anatomy of a block"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/terminology/what-is-block-dark.png"
    alt="Anatomy of a block"
  />
</Frame>

This is an example of an Ask AI Block. This block has multiple parameters, inputs and an output.

| I/O               | name               | type     |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Input & Parameter | `question`         | string   |
| Input & Parameter | `context`          | string   |
| Input             | `function`         | string   |
| Parameter         | `model_preference` | select   |
| Parameter         | `json_mode`        | checkbox |
| Parameter         | `cache_response`   | checkbox |
| Output            | `chatgpt_response` | string   |
