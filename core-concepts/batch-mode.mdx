Batch Mode allows certain blocks to process multiple inputs or outputs simultaneously.
When enabled, Batch Mode automatically converts the types of inputs and outputs into lists, enabling repeated execution of the same operation across multiple items.

Let's say you're migrating data from Google Sheets to your Notion database. `Read from Google Sheets` block naturally returns a list of rows, manually inputting each row into Notion would be arduous and inefficient. Here's where Batch Mode comes in handy. By activating Batch Mode within the `Notion Writer`, you can effortlessly write the content of all rows simultaneously into the database. This not only saves time but also optimizes the data migration process.

You can think of Batch Mode as running your block in loop.
