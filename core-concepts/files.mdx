You can use and process external data within your automations by uploading files to Keyflow. Similarly, all the files generated during the execution of an automation are also saved so they can either be used to download or use that data as an input for other blocks.

  **Supported file types include** .pdf, .csv, .txt, .html, .json, .docx, .zip, .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .mp3, mp4, .m4a, .wav

## File Organization and Accessibility

All uploaded files, along with those generated during automation execution, are conveniently stored in the "Files" tab of Keyflow. This centralized repository allows users to efficiently manage and access their data assets.

### Scopes of File Existence

Files within Keyflow can exist within three distinct scopes, each serving unique purposes:

1. **Space Scope**: Files uploaded within this scope have global accessibility, making them available for use across all workflows within the application. This way external data being used in multiple flows need not to be uploaded repeatedly and this keeps your storage limit in check.

2. **Flow Scope**: Files uploaded within a specific flow remain confined to that workflow, offering localized access within its operational context. This scope enhances workflow organization and ensures data privacy and integrity.

3. **Run Scope**: Primarily utilized for generated files, the run scope tags each file created when running an automation to prevent overrides. This ensures data integrity by preserving the unique outputs generated during each automation run.

### Building a Knowledge Base

Keyflow empowers users to build a comprehensive knowledge base by leveraging uploaded data assets. This knowledge base serves as a foundational resource for AI blocks within automations, enabling grounded responses, accurate results, and enhanced user experiences.

With Keyflow's robust file management capabilities, users can strengthen their decision-making processes, and build a dynamic knowledge base to drive operational efficiency.
