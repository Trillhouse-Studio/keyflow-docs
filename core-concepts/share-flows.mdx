Enhance your building experience by exploring the collaborative potential of Keyflow. The Share Flows feature empowers you to share your automation with your friends, community, and even your end users. Share Flows offers three distinct sharing methods: Form, App, and Blueprint, each tailored to suit diverse collaboration needs.

## 3 Unique ways to share a flow

1. **Share as Form** -- This allows you to create and share a customized form or survey, collecting inputs necessary to execute the flow. Once submitted, the flow is automatically triggered, using the provided data to run the automation. This method streamlines collecting form responses and processing them instantly as they come in.

2. **Share as App** -- With Share as App, collaboration becomes interactive and dynamic. Similar to Share as form, users provide input data with a customized form, but instead of just triggering the flow, the app waits for the output of the automation. Once the flow completes its execution, the output is displayed to the user, enabling real-time interaction and feedback.

3. **Share as Blueprint** -- It offers a collaborative framework for sharing your automation with the wider community or your individual friends and team. By sharing your flow as a blueprint, others can duplicate it, run it, or even continue building upon your foundation.

The two components of building these nested automations are [input blocks](https://docs.keyflow.space/blocks/core/input) and [output blocks](https://docs.keyflow.space/blocks/core/output).

Input Blocks determine your inputs of the existing flow as a block, acting as the entry point for data or information. They decide the inputs your flow will work with, setting the stage for its execution. Output Blocks, on the other hand, determine the outcome of your automation. They shape the output of your automation which can later be used with other blocks.

## Why Share Flows?

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Share Flows facilitates seamless collaboration by providing multiple sharing options tailored to diverse use cases.
2. **Effortless Sharing**: Share your automations effortlessly with colleagues, friends, or the Keyflow community, expanding your collaborative reach.
3. **Community Engagement**: Contribute to a thriving ecosystem of shared knowledge and innovation by sharing your automation as blueprints with the broader Keyflow community.
