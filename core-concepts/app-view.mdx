description: All flows are apps

Keyflow automatically deploys all your flows as an app. You can update the app by making changes to the underlying flow and saving it.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/core-concepts/flow-as-app-light.png"
    alt="Flow as App"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/core-concepts/flow-as-app-dark.png"
    alt="Flow as App"
  />
</Frame>

Here are [examples of useful apps](https://keyflow.space/templates) we built using Keyflow.

## Concepts

### Inputs

You can add inputs to your app by adding input blocks to your flow. This will create an interface for you in the app view to collect

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/core-concepts/input-block-light.png"
    alt="Input Block"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/core-concepts/input-block-dark.png"
    alt="Input Block"
  />
</Frame>

### Outputs

If you want display any data processed by block in your app. You need to connect output blocks to those data handles in flow.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/core-concepts/output-block-light.png"
    alt="Output Block"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/core-concepts/output-block-dark.png"
    alt="Output Block"
  />
</Frame>

### Accessing App

You can find the link to your app view in Share tab (rocket icon) > App View

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/core-concepts/app-view-light.png"
    alt="App View"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/core-concepts/app-view-dark.png"
    alt="App View"
  />
</Frame>

You can also quickly open the app view by clicking on (link icon) beside the flow name in your builder.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/core-concepts/app-view-title-bar-light.png"
    alt="Navigate to App View"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/core-concepts/app-view-title-bar-dark.png"
    alt="Navigate to App View"
  />
</Frame>
