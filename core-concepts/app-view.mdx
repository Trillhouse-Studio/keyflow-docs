Keyflow automatically deploys all your `flows` as an app. You can update the app by making changes to the underlying flow and saving it.

The app you see above*.* Here are examples of useful **apps we built using Keyflow.**

### Inputs

You can add inputs to your app by adding input blocks to your flow. This will create an interface for you in the app view to collect

### Outputs

If you want display any data processed by block in your app. You need to connect output blocks to those data handles in flow.
