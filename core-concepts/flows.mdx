## What is a Flow?

Flows, short for workflows, are built by connecting blocks to execute specific tasks.

When a workflow is run, data passes from one block to the next, with each block manipulating or generating content along the way. Here is an example of a workflow that I use to automatically draft a response to my emails in my writing style.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/terminology/what-is-flow-light.png"
    alt="Example of a flow in Keyflow"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/terminology/what-is-flow-dark.png"
    alt="Example of a flow in Keyflow"
  />
</Frame>

<Info>
  I mark emails I want to generate an reply for with a label auto-reply in my
  gmail. Keyflow then reads all those emails and generates a reply for all
  emails in my writing style and saves it as a draft for me to review.

### Building a flow

The flow builder is a large canvas for you to design your personalized workflows. Each block can be found in the Block list on the left side.

Blocks are dragged and dropped onto the canvas one at a time. Once they're on the canvas they're ready to be connected together.

The inputs of one block are derived from the outputs of another.

### The standard format of a flow

Most flows we've built or user build follow a general pattern ->Â Ingest data, prepare it for the AI, process it with AI and output a result.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Loaders">
    Flows normally start off with the ingestion of some sort of data. The data
    being ingested can be thousands of links in a csv, an uploaded file, a
    scraped website etc. This data is the content
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Modifiers">
    These blocks are the backbone of our workflow. They are the helper functions
    that make everything possible. They allow us to perform any number of data
    manipulation tasks like reformatting strings, reading values from jsons,
    extracting columns from csv etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Using AI">
    AI Blocks are the source of reasoning in the workflow and can ingest the
    loaded data and summarize, answer questions, categorize etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Writers">
    These are almost always the very last step of our workflows. They touch the
    outside world and turn the AI processed output into a tangible, valuable
    result. Blocks that generate files, interact with Google Sheets, Notion
    Databases and more live in this category.
