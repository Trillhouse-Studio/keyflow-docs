## What is a Flow?

Flows, short for workflows, are built by connecting blocks to automate your business processes. A flow allows you to visually see the process you want to automate. Most of our customers use Keyflow to automate processes that require reasoning and intelligence.

They automate these processes using Large Language Models technology that powers apps like ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini and Meta AI.

<Info>
  I mark emails I want to generate an reply for with a label auto-reply in my
  gmail. Keyflow then reads all those emails and generates a reply for all
  emails in my writing style and saves it as a draft for me to review.

### Building a flow

The flow builder is a large canvas for you to design your personalized workflows. Each block can be found in the Block list on the left side.

Blocks are dragged and dropped onto the canvas one at a time. Once they're on the canvas they're ready to be connected together.

The inputs of one block are derived from the outputs of another.

### The standard format of a flow

Here is a basic mental model we use to build flows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Loading data">
    You can load data from files, the apps you use or the open internet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transform data (optional)">
    Use data modifiers blocks to modify the data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyzing with AI">Use AI blocks to analyze the data</Step>
  <Step title="Transform data (optional)">
    Use data modifiers blocks to modify the data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    Write the data or take action on the apps you already use{" "}
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can run a flow manually or trigger them automatically by setting up [Triggers](/core-concept/triggers).
