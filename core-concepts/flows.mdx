## What is a Flow?

Flows, short for workflows, are built by connecting blocks to automate your business processes. A flow allows you to visually see the process you want to automate. Most of our customers use Keyflow to automate processes that require reasoning and intelligence.

They automate these processes using Large Language Models technology that powers apps like ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini and Meta AI.

<Info>
  I mark emails I want to generate an reply for with a label auto-reply in my
  gmail. Keyflow then reads all those emails and generates a reply for all
  emails in my writing style and saves it as a draft for me to review.

### Building a flow

The flow builder is a large canvas for you to design your personalized workflows. Each block can be found in the Block list on the left side.

Blocks are dragged and dropped onto the canvas one at a time. Once they're on the canvas they're ready to be connected together.

The inputs of one block are derived from the outputs of another.

### The standard format of a flow

Here is a basic mental model we use to build flows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Loading data">
    Flows normally start off with the ingestion of some sort of data. The data
    being ingested can be thousands of links in a csv, an uploaded file, a
    website url etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transform data (optional)">
    These blocks are the backbone of our workflow. They are the helper functions
    that make everything possible. They allow us to perform any number of data
    manipulation tasks like reformatting strings, reading values from jsons,
    extracting columns from csv etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyzing with AI">
    AI Blocks are the source of reasoning in the workflow and can summarize,
    answer questions, categorize etc. on the content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Action">
    These are almost always the very last step of our workflows. They touch the
    outside world and turn the AI processed output into a tangible, valuable
    result. Blocks that generate files, interact with Google Sheets, Notion
    Databases and more live in this category.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can run a flow manually or trigger them automatically by setting up [Triggers](/core-concept/triggers).
