Any flow you build in keyflow can be used as a block in another flow. This powerful feature allows you build a network of workflows that call each other.

This functionality is crucial for Keyflow as it allows us to build small processes and automations that interact with each other.

For example, assume you want to build an Email Assistant. You can start this by first building an automation that categorizes your email into different buckets like `bug report` , `Academic pricing` , etc.

You can build an automation to handle each type of email you want your AI assistant to process and call route them appropriately. See example below

Everything is a process and creating processes within processes helps you use keyflow in a powerful way to automate your business.
