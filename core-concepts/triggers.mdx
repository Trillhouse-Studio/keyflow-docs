You can set Triggers to a flow to kick them off based on an certain events. We have three types of triggers.

## Scheduled Triggers

This trigger allows you to schedule your flows. You can schedule them as cron jobs. Cron is a powerful syntax that allows you to define a schedule. Learn more about Cron Syntax

## Gmail Triggers

This allows you trigger your flows when the following events happen in your gmail inbox.

3. You receive an email
4. You delete an email
5. You apply a label to an email
6. You remove a label to an email

This trigger also passes the contents of the email to your flow as input. This includes the sender's email ID and name, the receiver's email ID and name, subject, body, and attachments (if any).

<Note>
  To configure Gmail Triggers, you will first need to authenticate your Gmail
  account with Keyflow. Navigate to your
  [credentials](https://keyflow.space/settings/credentials) page and connect
  your Google Mail using "Read Edit & Send Emails"
</Note>

## API Triggers

You can also trigger your workflows as an API. This the most flexible way to trigger your flows outside your Keyflow. You can check out our API reference here.
