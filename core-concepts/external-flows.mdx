description: Build flexible nested automations with existing flows as blocks
---

External Flows empower you to seamlessly use an existing automation as a block within a flow. The two components of building these nested automations are [input blocks](https://docs.keyflow.space/blocks/core/input) and [output blocks](https://docs.keyflow.space/blocks/core/output).

Input Blocks determine your inputs of the existing flow as a block, acting as the entry point for data or information. They decide the inputs your flow will work with, setting the stage for its execution. Output Blocks, on the other hand, determine the outcome of your automation. They shape the output of your automation which can later be used with other blocks.

By utilizing External Flows, you gain the flexibility to structure your automation like building blocks, making it easy to manage and modify as needed.

## Why Use External Flows?

1. **Modular organization:** Breaking down complex automation into smaller, modular components enhances clarity and maintainability. By utilizing External Flows, you can compartmentalize intricate logic into distinct, self-contained automations. This not only streamlines your current workflow but also facilitates future adjustments and updates.
2. **Complex flows with infinite nesting possibilities:** Picture this -- overseeing a bustling customer support department, handling huge volumes of inquiries and issues daily. With External Flows, you can easily build and navigate through intricate automation layers like a seasoned conductor and then orchestrate each layer to work as a single complex flow built to handle various scenarios.

This multi-tiered approach enables the possibility of building complex automation, in this case, handling multiple customer interactions receives the attention it deserves, regardless of the complexity of the workflow. So, bid farewell to tangled processes and embrace the clarity and efficiency External Flows bring to your customer support endeavors
