description: Learn about the Block Versioning in Keyflow.

Not all blocks behave the same way they did when launched, some have been either optimized or modified. This is possible due to Block Versioning.
We create and maintain different versions of a block such that your automations can run smoothly even if you are using legacy version of the block.

### Updating a Block

If your flow is running a legacy version, you will see a prompt inside the node asking you to update your block. Click on the prompt and your block will be updated smoothly without breaking anything else in your flow.
