## Start with our examples

The best way to experience the power of Keyflow is by running a `flow`. We have built some example `flows` you can try right away. [Check them out here](https://keyflow.space/templates)

Let’s go through an example to understand how a `flow` works. We will pick _“Youtube Article Generator”_ for demonstration purposes.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/quickstart/youtube-article-generator-light.png"
    alt="Youtube Article Generator Workflow"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/quickstart/youtube-article-generator-dark.png"
    alt="Youtube Article Generator Workflow"
  />
</Frame>

### Loading data

We start the `flow` with an `Input block` that provides the link of the Youtube video to be transcribed.

<Tip>
   The data a `block` returns can be connected to inputs of other `blocks` .
  Here we connect `value` from Input Block to the `video_link` of Get Youtube
  Transcript Block.
</Tip>

### Modifying data

Text block allows us to format text with any number of inputs. We can combine multiple strings in any order of our choice using this block.

To combine the strings, simply specify the format in which you want them. For example to combine two inputs consecutively, use `{input_1} {input_2}` as the placeholders.

Here we take `transcript` from the Get Youtube Transcript block and combine it with the context we want to provide to the LLM. This allows us to consolidate the transcript provided by the previous block and the context we want to provide to the LLM in a single `question` for AI Analysis.

Now we have data we can pass for AI analysis!

### AI Analysis

We take the Text block to combine the provided transcript along with our context. We can provide the context or ask any question in plain English!

Here we ask it to create an article from the transcript provided. The exact context is a bit more detailed. You can think of the context as a `prompt`. The better you prompt the model, the better results you get.

We have provided a default prompt to help you get easy to understand articles straight from the video. You can modify the prompt as per your liking.

### Taking Actions

Once AI has analysed the data, we can take actions on any apps we use. We can save it Notion, Google Docs, Google Sheets, or we can send it in an email or as an Whatsapp message. The sky is the limit!

### Running a flow

Now we understand how the flow functions. Let’s run it! You can simply run a `flow` by hitting the run button in the top right corner. Running a workflow will auto-save the current version of your workflow.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-light.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-dark.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
</Frame>

After hitting run, you will see the workflow in real-time as the blocks are being executed. The outputs of each block will be displayed in the side panel after they have completed processing.

  This template uses the Gmail integration in Keyflow, so you must connect a
  gmail account first by navigating to the [credentials
  page](https://keyflow.space/settings/credentials) and connecting your Gmail
  account

## Automating Flows

Keyflow is all about removing friction and automating your life. Running a `flow` by clicking a button is cool but we don’t want to manually trigger them everytime we need something done.

You can create triggers to automatically run your flows! You can automatically trigger them:

1. On a schedule
2. When you receive an email
3. When you remove/delete an email
4. When you apply or remove a label to an email
5. When you upload a file to Google Drive (coming soon ✨)
6. via our API
