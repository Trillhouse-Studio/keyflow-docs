## Basic Terminology

`flow`: process or workflow you want to automate

`blocks` : logical units that perform an action

`blocks` are building blocks that build up your process or workflows called `flows`

## Start with our examples

The best way to experience the power of Keyflow is by running a `flow`. We have built some example `flows` you can try right away. **Check them out here**

Let‚Äôs go through an example to understand how a `flow` works. We will pick _‚ÄúNewsletter digest‚Äù_ for demonstration purposes.

### Loading data

We start the `flow` with a `Read Gmail block` that reads data from my inbox. In this particular case, it reads the `20` most recent emails with label `newsletter` applied to it.

> üí°¬†The data a `block` returns can be connected to inputs of other `blocks` . Here we connect `email_body` and `email_subject` output of Gmail block to a text block.

### Modifying data

Text block allows us to format text with any number of inputs. Here we take data like `email_body` and `email_subject` and format in the following string.

```jsx
Email Subject: {subject}
Email Body: {body}
```

Notice that Text block is in batch mode, which means, it processes a list of emails and for each email, it creates the text format you see above. You can learn more about **Batch mode in Core Concepts.**

Next we take a list of formatted text from Text block and join it into one string (text) using Join Text Array block. We separate each email in this text with ‚Äú===================‚Äù demiliter.

Now we have data we can pass for AI analysis!

### AI Analysis

We take Join Text Array output which is all our newsletter email data and pass it as `context` to Ask AI block. This gives the AI context on all our emails. Now we can ask it any question in plain english!

Here we ask it to create a bullet point digest of all my news letter. The exact question is bit more detailed. You can think of the question as a `prompt` . The better you prompt the model, the better results you get. Here is a guide on how to write better prompts.

### Taking Actions

Once AI has analysed the data, we can take actions on any apps we use. We can save it Notion, Google Docs, Google Sheets, or we c.n send it in an email or as an Whatsapp message. The sky is the limit!

In our case, we will send it to ourselves as an email using Send Email Notification block. This will send an email to the recipient from founders@keyflow.space. If you want to send an email from your inbox, use our Gmail or Outlook blocks.

### Running a flow

Now we understand how the flow functions. Let‚Äôs run it! You can simply run a `flow` by hitting the run button in the top right corner. Running a workflow will auto-save the current version of your workflow.

  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-dark.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
</Frame>

After hitting run, you will see the workflow in real-time as the blocks are being executed. The outputs of each block will be displayed in the side panel after they have completed processing.

<Note>
  This template uses the Gmail integration in Keyflow, so you must connect a
  gmail account first by navigating to the [credentials
  page](https://keyflow.space/settings/credentials) and connecting your Gmail
  account

## Automating Flows

Keyflow is all about removing friction and automating your life. Running a `flow` by clicking a button is cool but we don‚Äôt want to manually trigger them everytime we need something done.

You can create triggers to automatically run your flows! You can automatically trigger them:

1. On a schedule
2. When you receive an email
3. When you remove/delete an email
4. When you apply or remove a label to an email
5. When you upload a file to Google Drive (coming soon ‚ú®)
6. via our API

### Get started with templates

The best way to get started is by using a prebuilt template!

We've built 50+ functional workflows categorized by their use cases for you to browse, explore and learn Keyflow. You can use these to understand how things work or to run out of the box, each is built to be immediately useful

Get started with [templates here](https://www.keyflow.space/templates)

For this quickstart guide, we'll pick the <i>["Email Auto-Replier"](https://www.keyflow.space/templates/administration/email-auto-replier)</i> under the `administration` category of the templates. Simply open the template's page using the link and click on the <b>"Use Template"</b> button

## Next Steps

Now that you have seen how easily an automation can be run in Keyflow. You can now further explore the platform and Add content directly in your files with MDX syntax and React components. You can use any of our components, or even build your own.
