## Basic terminology

1. `flow` -- process or workflow you want to automate
2. `blocks` -- logical units that perform an action

**Blocks** are building blocks that build up your process or workflows called **flows**.

## Start with our examples

The best way to experience the power of Keyflow is by running a flow. We have built over 60 flows you can try right away. [Check them out here](https://www.keyflow.space/templates)

Let‚Äôs go through an example to understand how a flow works. We will pick [‚ÄúNewsletter digest‚Äù](https://www.keyflow.space/templates/personal/newsletter-digest) for demonstration purposes.

  />
</Frame>

### Loading Data

We start the flow with a **Read Gmail** block that reads data from my inbox. In this particular case, it reads at most 5 most recent emails with label **"Keyflow/newsletter"** applied to it.

<Note>
  üí°¬†The output of a block can be connected to inputs of other blocks. Here we
  connect `sender`, `email_body` and `email_subject` output of Gmail block to a
  text block named as "Newsletter Content".
</Note>

### Modifying It

Text block allows us to format text with any number of inputs. Here we take data from gmail format in the following string.

```shell
Sender's Email: {email}

Email Subject: {subject}
Email Body: {body}
```

Notice that Text block is in **batch mode**, which means, it processes a list of emails and for each email, it creates the text format you see above. You can learn more about [Batch mode in Core Concepts](/core-concepts/batch-mode).

Later we take the AI responses join it into one string (text) seperated by new line using Join Text Array block.

Now we have data we can pass for AI analysis!

### AI Analysis

We take Join Text Array output which is all our summarized newsletter email data and pass it as context to Ask AI block. This gives the AI context on all our emails. Now we can ask it any question in plain english!

Here we ask it to create a bullet point digest of all my news letter. The exact question is bit more detailed. You can think of the question as a prompt . The better you prompt the model, the better results you get. Here is a guide on [writing better prompts]().

### Taking Actions

Once AI has analysed the data, we can take actions on any apps we use. We can save it Notion, Google Docs, Google Sheets, or we can send it in an email or as an Whatsapp message. The sky is the limit! Here we send the output newsletter digest and send it as a message in our discord community.

## Running a flow

Now we understand how the flow functions. Let‚Äôs run it! You can simply run a flow by hitting the run button in the top right corner. Running a workflow will auto-save the current version of your workflow.

<Frame>
  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-light.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/quickstart/toolbar-dark.png"
    alt="Toolbar at the top-right of the canvas"
  />
</Frame>

After hitting run, you will see the workflow in real-time as the blocks are being executed. The outputs of each block will be displayed in the side panel after they have completed processing.

<Note>
  This template uses the Gmail integration in Keyflow, so you must connect a
  gmail account first by navigating to the [credentials
  page](https://keyflow.space/settings/credentials) and connecting your Gmail
  account

## Automating flows

Keyflow is all about removing friction and automating your life. Running a flow by clicking a button is cool but we don‚Äôt want to manually trigger them everytime we need something done.

You can create triggers to automatically run your flows! You can automatically trigger them:

1. On a schedule
2. When you receive an email
3. When you remove/delete an email
4. When you apply or remove a label to an email
5. When you upload a file to Google Drive (coming soon ‚ú®)
6. via our API
