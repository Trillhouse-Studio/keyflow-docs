Cron syntax is used to schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals. A cron expression consists of five fields, representing different time units, plus an optional sixth field for the year:

1. **Minute** (0-59)
2. **Hour** (0-23)
3. **Day of Month** (1-31)
4. **Month** (1-12 or Jan-Dec)
5. **Day of Week** (0-6 or Sun-Sat)
6. **Year** (optional, e.g., 2023)

Each field can contain:

- **A specific value** (e.g., `5` for the 5th minute)
- **A range** (e.g., `1-5` for minutes 1 through 5)
- **A list** (e.g., `1,15,30` for minutes 1, 15, and 30)
- **A step value** (e.g., `/15` for every 15 minutes)
- **Wildcard ``** to represent all possible values in that field.

**Creating Custom Cron Expressions:**

To create a custom cron expression, you need to define the schedule by specifying the desired values in each field. For example:

- **Every day at midnight:** `0 0 * * *`
- **Every Monday at 8 AM:** `0 8 * * 1`
- **Every 15 minutes:** `/15 * * * *`

This flexibility allows you to schedule tasks with precision according to your needs.
