## Welcome to theÂ **Keyflow** ðŸ‘‹

Keyflow is a platform to rapidly and visually build AI workflows without writing any code. Our AI agents can automate parts of businesses using the same AI tech that powers ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini, and Meta AI.

What you see below is a workflow aka flow built in Keyflowâ€™s canvas . A flow is built by connecting logical components called blocks.
