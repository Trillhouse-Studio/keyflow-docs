### **Overview:**

The `Switch` block is designed to execute specific subflows based on a defined criterion evaluated against a list of cases. This functionality enables dynamic and conditional processing, allowing for tailored actions based on varying input scenarios.

### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature                           | Type   | Simple Explanation                                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| input  | `cases`                           | list   | A collection of cases used for comparison against the criterion.     |
| input  | `criterion`                       | string | The value that will be compared with each case in the provided list. |
| output | `{case_name}` (dynamically named) | any    | Executes the connected subflow corresponding to the matched case.    |

<Note>
  Only the subflow connected to the output handle corresponding to the matched
  case will be executed.

### Use Cases

Consider how this block can enhance your workflows in practical situations:

- **Dynamic Case-based Processing:** In a customer support application, you might want different responses triggered depending on issue categories (like billing, technical support, etc.), enabling targeted assistance without manual intervention.
- **Conditional Data Routing:** For an e-commerce platform, use this block to navigate orders through various processing lanes based on criteria such as payment status (e.g., pending payment versus confirmed), ensuring efficient order management.

- **Multi-Scenario Handling:** Imagine a health monitoring app that sends alerts according to different patient data readings; by employing this block, you can process multiple condition evaluations seamlessly within one flow and respond accordingly.

In general, whenever decisions need to be made or actions taken based on varying conditions or scenarios, the `Case Evaluator` block serves as an essential tool!
