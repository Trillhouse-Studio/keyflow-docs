## Overview

The Mux (Multiplexer) block takes multiple inputs and outputs the first non-null value among them. It is designed to work in conjunction with a [**Switch Block**](/blocks/flow-control/switch) based on specific conditions or criteria. and allows you to efficiently handle scenarios where you have multiple sources of data and need to prioritize them based on availability.

## Block Inputs

| Name      | Type | Description             |
| --------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| `input_1` | any  | The first input value.  |
| `input_2` | any  | The second input value. |

<Note>
  To allow accepting more than than 2 inputs, You can clik the "+" or "-" icon
  below the input name to add or remove new input handles that you can connect
  other blocks to.
</Note>

## Block Outputs

| Name     | Type | Description                                      |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `output` | any  | The first non-null value among the input values. |

## Use Cases

1. Ensure data integrity by selecting the most relevant or accurate input value among multiple options.
2. Streamline decision-making processes by automatically choosing the appropriate input value based on specific conditions.
3. Optimize workflows by dynamically selecting inputs based on real-time data or user interactions.
