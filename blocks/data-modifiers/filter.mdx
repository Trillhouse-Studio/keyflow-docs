## Overview

Selectively passes through data that meets particular condition also known as a criteria. When you need to reduce or filter elements from a list, Filter block is the one you need.

It supports various condition types such as empty values, numerical comparisons, boolean states, and text-based matching conditions. The Filter block is a critical component in workflows where data needs to be vetted or cleaned, passing only the entries that fulfill the given criteria.

## Block Inputs

| Name                 | Type     | Description                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `value`              | any[ ]   | The actual data to filter.                                                                         |
| `condition_value`    | any[ ]   | The criterion against which to filter the values. If not provided, the value is also the criterion |
| `condition_type`     | selector | Identifies the type of filter condition to apply.                                                  |
| `condition`          | any      | Specifies the condition to be met for the filtering process.                                       |
| `output_blank_value` | boolean  | When enabled, outputs a blank value if it doesn't match the filtering condition.                   |

## Block Outputs

| Name              | Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `filtered_output` | Data | The result of the filter operation. Contains either the original input value that met the filter condition, or a blank value if the condition wasn't met and 'output_blank_value' is set to true. |

## Available list of conditions

- **Is empty:** Checks if the value is empty.
- **Is not empty:** Checks if the value is not empty.
- **[Number] is greater than:** Checks if the number is greater than the specified value.
- **[Number] is less than:** Checks if the number is less than the specified value.
- **[Number] is equal to:** Checks if the number is equal to the specified value.
- **[Boolean] is true:** Checks if the boolean value is true.
- **[Boolean] is false:** Checks if the boolean value is false.
- **[Text] is exact match of:** Checks if the text is an exact match of the specified value.
- **[Text] contains:** Checks if the text contains the specified value.
- **[Text] does not contains:** Checks if the text does not contain the specified value.
- **[Text] is in:** Checks if the text is in the specified list of values.
- **[Text] is not in:** Checks if the text is not in the specified list of values.
- **[Text] starts with:** Checks if the text starts with the specified value.
- **[Text] does not starts with:** Checks if the text does not start with the specified value.
- **[Text] ends with:** Checks if the text ends with the specified value.
- **[Text] does not ends with:** Checks if the text does not end with the specified value.

## Use Cases

1. **Filtering out records:** Exclude records that do not meet certain thresholds, like age or price limits.
2. **Empty Value Handling:** Select only those rows from a dataset where a particular column is not empty.
3. **Boolean Field Subsetting:** Include only true or false values from a boolean field.
4. **String Processing:** Process only items with specific keywords, prefixes, or suffixes.
