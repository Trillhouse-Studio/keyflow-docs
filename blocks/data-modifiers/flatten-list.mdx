### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature      | Type  | Simple Explanation                                                         |
| ------ | ------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| input  | `input_list` | any[] | The nested list you want to flatten into a single level.                   |
| output | `list`       | any[] | The resulting flat list containing all elements from the nested structure. |

### Use Cases

Consider how this block can facilitate data manipulation in various scenarios:

- **Data Simplification:** When working with complex datasets, such as user lists categorized by preferences, this block effortlessly flattens them for easier management.
- **Report Preparation:** If your project requires compiling information from multiple layers of categorization, use this feature to create a comprehensive report without the clutter of nesting.
- **API Response Handling:** When dealing with API responses that return multi-layered arrays, flattening them aids in simplifying subsequent data operations in your application.
- **Data Migration:** During transitions from one system to another where data structures may differ, human-readable flat lists can be essential for ensuring accuracy and completeness.

In summary, whenever you need to streamline multi-dimensional data into an easily workable format, the `Flatten List` block proves invaluable!
