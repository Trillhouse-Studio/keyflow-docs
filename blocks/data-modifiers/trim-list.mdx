### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature        | Type   | Simple Explanation                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| input  | `list`         | any[]  | The list that you wish to trim according to the specified parameters.                                                                       |
| input  | `no_of_items`  | number | Indicates how many items should be retained from the start of the list; either this or both `start_index` and `end_index` must be provided. |
| input  | `start_index`  | number | The index from which items will start being included in the trimmed result.                                                                 |
| input  | `end_index`    | number | The index at which inclusion ends for items in the trimmed outcome.                                                                         |
| output | `trimmed_list` | any[]  | A new list created by trimming down to either a specified number of items from the beginning or those within defined indices.               |

### Use Cases

Consider these practical examples of how this block can enhance your workflow:

- **Limiting List Length:** In scenarios such as pagination, where displaying only a fixed number of results is crucial, this block efficiently restricts outputs.
- **Selecting List Range:** When analyzing survey responses, you may want just particular entries â€” using this block allows easy extraction based on precise start and end points.

- **Data Cleanup:** During data processing, unnecessary elements can burden analysis; utilizing this tool clarifies datasets by removing excess information seamlessly.

- **Data Filtering:** In cases where you're collecting user feedback across various categories, use specifications with range limits to extract only pertinent insights that improve reporting quality.

In essence, whenever there's a need to optimize lists by controlling their size or defining specific segments for focus, the `Trim List` block proves invaluable!
