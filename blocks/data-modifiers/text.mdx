### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature   | Type     | Simple Explanation                                                                            |
| ------ | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| input  | `format`  | Template | Specifies how to combine the input strings using `{input_1}` and `{input_2}` as placeholders. |
| input  | `input_1` | String   | Represents the first string that you want to combine. (Optional)                              |
| input  | `input_2` | String   | Represents the second string that needs to be combined. (Optional)                            |
| output | `text`    | String   | The final text generated by merging all inputs according to the defined format.               |

<Note>
  The inputs, `input_1` and `input_2`, are dynamic handles that change based on
  different inputs provided in conjunction with the format specified. By
  default, the format is set as "`{input_1}` `{input_2}`." Any word encapsulated
  within curly braces "{}" becomes an input handle.

### Use Cases

Consider how this block could be beneficial in various situations:

- **Personalized Messages:** Utilize this block to create tailored messages by merging elements like user names or specific greetings into one cohesive message.
- **Report Formatting:** When preparing reports, you can effortlessly standardize data combinations—such as merging titles, dates, or statistics—to maintain consistency across documents.
- **Prompt Engineering:** In automation processes involving language models (LLMs), construct well-organized prompts by blending structured queries with variable data points seamlessly.
- **Textual Information Integration:** If you're consolidating information from various sources—such as extracting quotes from interviews or summarizing insights—this tool allows for consistent integration of textual content.

In summary, whenever there's a need to merge different text inputs into one clear output based on a specified format, the `Text` block proves invaluable!
