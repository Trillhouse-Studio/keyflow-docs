| input  | `csv_file_name`         | file     | The target CSV file that needs modification, which must be in .csv format.                                 |
| input  | `column_index`          | number   | Identifies the position of the column to update (0 for the first column).                                  |

### Use Cases

Here’s how this block can streamline various tasks:

- **Merging New Data:** Suppose you’ve collected additional metrics from an ongoing project and need to integrate these into your existing dataset—this block facilitates seamless merging without losing any previous information.
- **Correcting Errors:** If you discover discrepancies within your dataset due to incorrect entries, this tool allows easy corrections by replacing erroneous values in designated columns effectively.
- **Adding Calculated Fields:** When analyzing sales data over different periods, you might want to add a calculated “growth rate” field based on other figures—this block enables creating dynamic fields directly linked to your underlying data.

In essence, any scenario requiring updates or enhancements within a CSV can be efficiently handled using the `Update CSV Column` block!
