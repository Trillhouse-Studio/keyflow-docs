### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature            | Type     | Simple Explanation                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| input  | `string`           | string   | The input string you want to split into an array of strings.                                                                                |
| input  | `split_characters` | string   | Characters that define where the original string will be divided. Defaults to a comma (,) if not specified.                                 |
| input  | `newline_split`    | boolean  | A flag indicating whether to also split the string on newline (\n) characters; selecting this will ignore any values in `split_characters`. |
| output | `string_array`     | string[] | The resulting array where each element represents a segment of the original string obtained from the split operation.                       |

### Use Cases

Consider how this block can enhance your workflow in various scenarios:

- **Dividing Text:** When analyzing lengthy documents, you may need to separate dialogues or paragraphs for deeper comprehension and editing.
- **Processing Lists:** If you frequently work with CSV data, this feature allows you to efficiently extract individual items from comma-separated values for further processing.
- **Extracting Elements:** In situations involving predefined formats like logs or configuration files, use this block to isolate specific elements swiftly and handle them as needed.
- **Data Cleanup:** Transform messy strings into organized arrays that can simplify validation tasks during data entry.

In conclusion, whenever there is a need to dissect a complex string into manageable pieces, the `Split Text` block proves invaluable!
