### Use Cases

Consider how this block can enhance efficiency in practical applications:

- **Document Compilation:** When preparing various documents for an event or distribution (like reports or presentations), this block simplifies packaging them into a single downloadable archive.
- **Backup Creation:** It is beneficial for generating backups by consolidating multiple important documents into one secure storage location.
