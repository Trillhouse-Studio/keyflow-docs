### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature                       | Type     | Simple Explanation                                                   |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| input  | `url`                         | string   | The URL of the website you wish to crawl.                            |
| input  | `depth`                       | number   | Determines how many layers deep the crawler will go; max value is 3. |
| input  | `domain_whitelist` (optional) | list     | Restricts crawling to specified domains only.                        |
| output | `url_list`                    | string[] | A collection of all URLs found during the crawl process.             |

<Warning>
  Setting a depth of 3 for the web crawler might take longer processing times as
  it will crawl nested links with exponential growth in complexity. Use it
  wisely.
</Warning>

<Info>
  The domain whitelist accepts domains such as "keyflow.space",
  "www.keyflow.space", or "docs.keyflow.space". You can also specify full URLs
  like "https://keyflow.space", and only the domain name will be processed by
  the crawler automatically.
