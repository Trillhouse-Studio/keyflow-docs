### Use Cases

Consider how this block can enhance workflows in various contexts:

- **Educational Tool:** Use this block to extract problems and their descriptions for teaching purposes, allowing students to engage with real coding challenges.
- **Algorithm Research:** Researchers can compare algorithm implementations by scraping various problems, helping them analyze different solution strategies based on GPT-generated code.
- **Language Adaptation:** Developers working in multiple languages can retrieve a single problem's details and generate corresponding solutions across different programming languages efficiently.
- **Coding Practice Consolidation:** If you're preparing for coding interviews, gather multiple practice problems in one step instead of manually browsing through each one individually.

In essence, whenever you need quick access to structured data from LeetCode problems for solution generation or analysis, the `Scrape LeetCode` block proves invaluable!
