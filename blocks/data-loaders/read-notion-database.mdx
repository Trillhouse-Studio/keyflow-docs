### Inputs & Outputs

| I/O    | Feature       | Type     | Simple Explanation                                                      |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| output | `page_id`     | string[] | The unique ID or link of individual pages within the specifieddatabase. |

<Note>
  The block outputs are variable for Read Notion Page because it depends on the

  input, all your notion database properties will automatically be included as
  individual handles that can be directly connected to other blocks for further
  data processing.
