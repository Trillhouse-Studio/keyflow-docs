title: Extract Notion Database Properties
---

### **Overview:**

The `Extract Database Properties` block is designed to retrieve all properties and their types from a Notion database. This functionality is especially valuable when generating content using LLMs, as having clear property definitions enables the generation of accurate content shapes that can be directly integrated into your Notion database.

<Note>
  To run this block, you will first need to authenticate your Notion account
  with Keyflow. Navigate to your
  [credentials](https://keyflow.space/settings/credentials) page and connect
  your Notion.
