title: Block Versioning
description: Maintain the continuity of your automations amidst significant block updates
---

Each time you drop a block into the builder, you are using the most recent version of the block.

All blocks are bound to change over time to fix bugs, provide better experience, or optimize performance. This may also modify the inputs and outputs of the blocks. However, this will not affect your existing automations. This is possible due to Block Versioning.

We create and maintain different versions of a block such that your automations can run smoothly even if you are using legacy version of the block. You can choose to opt-in to the latest update of a block if need be.

### Updating a Block

If your flow is running a legacy version of a block, you will see a callout inside prompting an update. Click on **"Update"** to start using the latest available version of the block.
