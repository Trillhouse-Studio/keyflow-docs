description: Manage changes made to your workflow with automatic versioning.
---

Every change you make to a workflow is automatically saved as a new version along with the timestamp of its creation. This allows you to easily revisit and review any previous version of your workflow, even after further changes have been made.

By storing the inputs and outputs of each node with every version, we ensure that you have a complete historical record of how your workflow was configured and operated at any point in time.

The purpose of this versioning system is to give you full control and transparency over your workflow's evolution. Whether you need to troubleshoot issues, track changes, or revert to an earlier state.
