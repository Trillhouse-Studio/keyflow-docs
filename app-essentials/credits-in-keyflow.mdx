## What are Credits?

Keyflow credits form the foundation of our usage-based system, designed to provide flexible, transparent, and fair pricing for our platform. They are the internal currency used within our platform to measure and manage usage of various features and resources.

### Credit Value

For reference purposes:

- 100 credits ≈ $1
- 1 credit ≈ $0.01 (1 cent)

Note: This conversion is approximate and used for illustrative purposes only.

## Credit Usage

Credits are consumed by various actions and resources within Keyflow:

| Resource       | Cost (Credits) |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Flow run       | 1              |
| AI Calls       | 1 - 20         |
| Premium Blocks | 10 - 200       |

<Note>
  {" "}
  Costs may vary based on the specific AI model or premium block used.
</Note>

## Monitoring and Managing Credit Usage

Users can monitor their credit usage in real-time through the Keyflow dashboard.

  />
</Frame>

When credits are exhausted, users can:

1. Upgrade to a higher tier plan
2. Purchase additional credits
3. Connect personal API keys to reduce credit consumption

<Warning>
  Only users in Plus or Business Plan can connect their personal API keys
</Warning>

## Special Considerations

### AI Model Pricing

Different AI models consume varying amounts of credits:

- **High-end models (GPT-4, Opus, etc)**: Up to 20 credits per call
- **Mid-range models (GPT-4o, Sonnet-3.5, etc)**: Approximately 10 credits per call
- **Basic models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, etc)**: 1 credit per call

### Premium Block Pricing

Premium blocks have varying credit costs based on their underlying API expenses. Costs range from 10 to 200 credits per use.

## Customizing Credit Allocations

Users can add credits to any plan using our slider tool:
