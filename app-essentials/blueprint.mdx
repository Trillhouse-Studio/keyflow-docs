description: Share your flows with others.
---

Once you have built a flow and saved it, you can share it with others as a blueprint via a link. Anyone will be able to view the flow you shared with this link.

The blueprint link of a flow will always point to the latest version of your flow. This means, if you share a link and make changes to the flow after sharing it, you donâ€™t need to reshare the flow. The same link will show the updates to your flow!

### Accessing Blueprints

You can enable sharing your flow as a blueprint under `Share` (rocket icon) tab > Blueprints

once you toggle sharing, it will show you a link to share your flow.
