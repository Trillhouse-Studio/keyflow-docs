Keyflow automatically deploys all your `flows` as an app. You can update the app by making changes to the underlying flow and saving it.

Above is the App View of the Youtube Article Generator Workflow. **App View** simplifies the interface and provides you with only the Inputs on the screen. This allows you to share your flows as apps without exposing the underlying working of the flow.

### Inputs

You can add inputs to your app by adding input blocks to your flow. This will create an interface for you in the app view to collect

### Outputs

If you want display any data processed by block in your app. You need to connect output blocks to those data handles in flow.

### Accessing App

You can find the link to your app view in `Share` (rocket icon) tab > App View

  <img
    className="block dark:hidden"

    alt="Share Flow as App"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
