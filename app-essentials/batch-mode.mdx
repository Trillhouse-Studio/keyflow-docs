**Batch Mode** in Keyflow streamlines processes by enabling certain blocks to handle multiple inputs concurrently, thus optimizing performance.

Consider a scenario where you have a list of strings that need to be modified. Reading every single element from the list and modifying it manually sounds lengthy and tiring. It can often lead to inefficiency and potential errors.

This is where **Batch Mode** comes in handy. Enable the Batch Mode in the `Text` block and it will take the elements from the list one after the other and modify it as per your specification.

Batch Mode operates like a loop, efficiently handling multiple inputs throughout the workflow, thus streamlining complex tasks and maximizing efficiency.
