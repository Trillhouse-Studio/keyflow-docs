title: Runs History
description: Track and manage all executions of your workflow.

Each time your workflow runs, it is logged as a separate run version. This means that not only are the outcomes of each run recorded, but also the specific inputs of every node during that run.

The **Run History Panel** displays the recent runs of the current workflow, providing a quick overview of each run's status, completion time, and duration. This panel gives you immediate insight into the performance of your workflow, helping you track its execution and navigate through different runs without leaving the workflow view.

The **Runs Page** in Keyflow allows you to view and manage the history of all the workflow executions. It provides a detailed overview of each workflow run, including its status, execution time, and related information. This page is essential for monitoring the performance and success of your workflows.

### Key Features

- **Run History Table**: Lists all workflow runs, including Run ID, Workflow name, Run Status, and Execution Time.
