## ðŸ§±Â What is a Block?

Blocks, short for building blocks, are logical units used to build flows. You can think of them as No-code lego pieces that you can connect to create a flow.

Each block runs some code in background to carry out a function in your flow.

You can add a block to your canvas by dragging and dropping them from the block list.

We have 7 types of blocks:

1. `Core`
2. `Data Loaders`
3. `AI`
4. `Data Modifiers`
5. `Flow Control`
6. `Data Writers`
7. `Database I/O`

All blocks take some inputs and produce some outputs. To configure a block you can simply click on it. It will open a side bar with configurable inputs.

  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/terminology/what-is-block-dark.png"
    alt="Anatomy of a block"
  />
</Frame>

You may also see inputs and output as handles on the left and right side of the block respectively.

You can connect blocks using these handles. Output data of a block can be connected to a input data of another block!

Connect as many blocks as you like. This creates a `flow` .

## Updating blocks

We make regular changes to all blocks to add functionality, improve performance and fix bugs. After we update a block, we preserve the older version of the blocks for flows that are already in use. We do this to avoid breaking your deployed flows. You will also see a notification on outdated blocks in flows to update them to newest version.

We highly recommend you keep the blocks in your workflows up-to date with the newest version for improved performance and better functionality.

We will send out emails when we make updates to blocks so you donâ€™t miss any updates :)

We make custom blocks for enterprise users â†’ [Request here](https://cal.com/keyflow/request-custom-automations)
