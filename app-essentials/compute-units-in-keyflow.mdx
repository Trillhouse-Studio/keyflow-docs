## What are Compute Units?

Keyflow compute units form the foundation of our usage-based system, designed to provide flexible, transparent, and fair pricing for our platform. They are the internal currency used within our platform to measure and manage usage of various features and resources.

### Compute Units Value

For reference purposes:

- 100 compute units ≈ $1
- 1 compute unit ≈ $0.01 (1 cent)

Note: This conversion is approximate and used for illustrative purposes only.

## Compute Unit Usage

Compute Units are consumed by various actions and resources within Keyflow:

| Resource       | Cost (Compute Units) |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| Flow run       | 1              |
| AI Calls       | 1 - 20         |
| Premium Blocks | 10 - 200       |

<Note>

  Costs may vary based on the specific AI model or premium block used.
</Note>

## Monitoring and Managing Compute Unit Usage

Users can monitor their compute unit usage in real-time through the Keyflow dashboard.

    src="/images/compute-unit-usage-light.png"
    alt="Compute Unit Usage Dashboard"
  />
  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/compute-unit-usage-dark.png"
    alt="Compute Unit Usage Dashboard"
  />
</Frame>

When compute units are exhausted, users can:

1. Upgrade to a higher tier plan
2. Purchase additional compute units
3. Connect personal API keys to reduce compute unit consumption

<Warning>
  Only users in Plus or Business Plan can connect their personal API keys
</Warning>

## Special Considerations

### AI Model Pricing

Different AI models consume varying amounts of compute units:

- **High-end models (GPT-4, Opus, etc)**: Up to 20 compute units per call
- **Mid-range models (GPT-4o, Sonnet-3.5, etc)**: Approximately 10 compute units per call
- **Basic models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, etc)**: 1 compute unit per call

### Premium Block Pricing

Premium blocks have varying compute unit costs based on their underlying API expenses. Costs range from 10 to 200 compute units per use.

## Customizing Compute Unit Allocations

Users can add compute units to any plan using our slider tool:

  <img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/compute-unit-slider-dark.png"
    alt="Compute Unit Slider"
  />
</Frame>

- $100 for additional 10,000 compute units / month
- $200 for additional 25,000 compute units / month
- $300 for additional 40,000 compute units / month
- $500 for additional 65,000 compute units / month
- $900 for additional 125,000 compute units / month

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the monthly compute unit allocation?">
    Each pricing plan includes a set amount of compute units that are refreshed at the
    start of each billing cycle. Visit our [Pricing
    Page](https://keyflow.space/pricing) to know more about compute units included in
    plans
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do unused compute units carry over to the next month?">
    No, unused compute units expire at the end of each billing cycle and do not roll
    over.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I get more compute units?">
    You can purchase additional compute units or upgrade your plan to receive a higher
    monthly allocation. Visit our [Pricing Page](https://keyflow.space/pricing)
    to upgrade or purchase more compute units
