Builder is the page where the automation magic happens. Here you'll see a canvas where you can drag and drop the blocks from the sidebar. You can also click on the block and it'll appear on the canvas.

Click on the I/O handles of the block and extend it to the I/O handle of another block to form a connection. These are called edges.

On the top left corner you will see an input field where you can name your workflows. A tag beside the name will indicate whether your workflow is `Saved` or in `Draft` mode. The clock icon next to it allows you to load the latest version of your worklfow.

On the top right corner you will find options to edit how your workflow is displayed, run the workflow and check out the output logs.

The floating bar on the bottom left corner enables you to modify your canvas view by zooming in/out, locking the canvas and fitting the viewport of canvas.

The leftmost sidebar contains different options for your workflows.

1. Blocks
2. Your Flows
