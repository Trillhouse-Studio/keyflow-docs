Enhance your building experience by exploring the collaborative potential of Keyflow. The Share Flows feature empowers you to share your automation with your friends, community, and even your end users. Share Flows offers two distinct sharing methods: **App** and **Blueprint**

## Two Unique ways to share a flow

1. **Share as App** -- With Share as App, collaboration becomes interactive and dynamic. Similar to Share as form, users provide input data with a customized form, but instead of just triggering the flow, the app waits for the output of the automation. Once the flow completes its execution, the output is displayed to the user, enabling real-time interaction and feedback.

2. **Share as Blueprint** -- It offers a collaborative framework for sharing your automation with the wider community or your individual friends and team. By sharing your flow as a blueprint, others can duplicate it, run it, or even continue building upon your foundation.

## Why Share Flows?

1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Share Flows facilitates seamless collaboration by providing multiple sharing options tailored to diverse use cases.
2. **Effortless Sharing**: Share your automations effortlessly with colleagues, friends, or the Keyflow community, expanding your collaborative reach.
3. **Community Engagement**: Contribute to a thriving ecosystem of shared knowledge and innovation by sharing your automation as blueprints with the broader Keyflow community.
